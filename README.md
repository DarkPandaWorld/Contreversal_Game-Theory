## Simulation 1: Basic Strategy Comparison

Simulation 1 explores the outcomes of different basic strategies in a game-theoretic setting. It compares how each strategy performs against others, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. The results provide insights into which strategies are more robust or vulnerable under various conditions.

## Simulation 2: Adaptive Strategy Dynamics

Simulation 2 investigates adaptive strategies where players adjust their behavior based on previous outcomes. This simulation demonstrates how strategies evolve over time and how adaptation can lead to equilibrium or cyclical patterns. The findings illustrate the impact of learning and adaptation in strategic interactions.
